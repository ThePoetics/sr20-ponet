In the neon glow of 2072 Seattle running solo is a death warrant.  Smart Shadowrunners 
find kindred spirits whose abilities compliment their own and bond together for mutual 
aid and benefit; gone are the days of legendary individuals doing it all &mdash; 
today's heroes are the elite teams which make up the stories and legends spread through 
the shadows.

  Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night Madman 
  drummers bummers, Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat In the dumps with 
  the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat With a boulder on my shoulder, 
  feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round With this very unpleasin', sneezin' 
  and wheezin, the calliope crashed to the ground

  I hear the drums echoing tonight But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
  She's coming in 12:30 flight The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards 
  salvation I stopped an old man along the way, Hoping to find some old forgotten words 
  or ancient melodies He turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, It's waiting there for you
