With backgrounds as disparate as their unique skillsets these four elite Shadowrunners 
have found themselves in the mean streets of Seattle, fighting for a little piece of the 
action.  Each of them seems to be running from something, but all of their eyes on the 
prize &mdash; retribution against the one who betrayed them and more importantly, 
understanding <em>why</em>.

Without friends or connections, our team of loners and gray-market miscreants has to 
scrimp and dodge the corporate operatives hired to counter their every move.  Who will 
they choose to trust?  What jobs are they willing to take?  In their quest for revenge, 
for answers, for freedom, what bridges will they cross, will they burn?  Above all else, 
who will they turn to when they need help?

As bright as the neon skies overhead shine, the cracks and hollows between the megas 
seem all the darker, ready to absorb and swallow whole those who would dare to live in 
them.  Friends and foes teem in the shades of grey, and nobody's PAN broadcases which 
one they are.  Join us as we watch our team lie, cheat, smooth-talk, bribe, and some 
times hurt others to get what they want.  After all, the acid rain washes everything 
away, right <em>omae</em>?
