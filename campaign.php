<H1>The Post-Crash World, Again</H1>

Though the gamemaster started playing Shadowrun when FASA introduced the world to 2050's 
Seattle time has marched on and progress has been the mantra of the day.  Returning to the 
setting that started off his role-playing career, a hobby that has taken more than 
two-thirds of his life, he is hoping to bring the streets of <i>Shadowrun, 20th Anniversary 
Edition</i> to a new collection of players, most of whom have never experienced Seattle 
like this setting provides.

<H1>Kickoff:  February 2014</H1>

In planning for the better part of a year, through various bumps and false-starts the 
campaign is all set to kick off in the early weeks of the new year.  Character concepts 
have been solidified and sheets are sure to follow soon, and everyone is waiting with 
great anticipation for the dice to hit the table.  The plan is to play every week which 
will provide active and engaging, continuing stories with as smooth a progression as 
possible.

<H1>Sharks in the Pool</H1>

The GM is a huge fan of the logistical, planned operation that goes off without a 
hitch owing to the extensive legwork performed before anyone steps foot near the target. 
With four players each providing unique styles of role-play the goal is to foster an 
environment that is tense but extremely rewarding for all involved.  At this time there 
are no plans to add more players, but the game master does know of several interested 
parties in case that does become an option.

<H1>Unlimited Possibilities</H1>

Shadowrun, unlike many D&D or L5R campaigns, can be presented in an "open world" setting 
where the player-characters largely dictate their own future, based upon their own actions, 
conscious of the repercussions or not.  The game master may at time have elements to 
include or suggested story arcs, but at the end of the day the decisions will be the 
characters' own, and they will write their own histories.  Daunting for some and 
crippling with choice paralysis for others, the hope is to provide a truly immersive 
world, a living and breathing 21st-century Seattle, to explore, discover, and perhaps 
ultimately to change.
